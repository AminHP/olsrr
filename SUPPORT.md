# Getting help with olsrr

Thanks for using olsrr. Before filing an issue, there are a few places
to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

* Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the 
[reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 
* If it's a question: post it on StackOverflow.
* If it's a bug: you're in the right place, file an issue.  
* If you're not sure, please feel free to email us at pkgs@rsquaredacademy.com

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/rsquaredacademy/olsrr/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. By 
default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can 
[edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) 
(e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you'd simply
remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

Thanks for your help!
